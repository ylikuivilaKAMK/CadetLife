Welcome to play Cadet Life!
You always wondered what it would be like in the military.
Well it depends on the military.
And wheather you have to carry the 50kg AA-machine gun with your squadmate every time your squad camps.

You will make choices and those choices will have consequences. And you will have to live with them.
That is if you manage to stay alive.

Momma provided when she could. It was difficult for a widow to care for three children.
